Cloth folding and manipulating
==================================
We are trying to create a system that would be able to master a process of cloth unfolding and folding by two armed robotic manipulator. This system has ambition to create a basis for testing of an another aproaches. For example for to test another cloth models. In this implementation we are using the cloth model developed by by Stephen Miller and his colleagues from Berkley university.

Whole repository is written as a single ROS package. The main parts of the system is written in python script language.

Important files
-----------------------------------
* scripts/FoldingProcess.py - A script that automatize folding process and operation with cloth model.
* manifest.xml - This file contains ros packages dependencies that are used in scripts.

How to make it run
-----------------------------------
All demand packages should be almost found on the git repositories at https://github.com/rll.
